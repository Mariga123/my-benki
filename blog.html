            <p>Below are ways which will come in handy during rainy days financially speaking.
                <br> This is how you come up with the rainy day funds to help you out of your troubles.

                            <p class="card-text">You should aim to have enough in your emergency fund to support
                                yourself for three to six months with no income–if you assume the worst, you’ll be
                                prepared for anything. Take a look at your monthly expenses and come up with a rough
                                estimate of how much you spend each month, then multiply that figure by anything between
                                three and six, and make that the amount you hope to have in your emergency fund.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">If you’re setting aside money for an emergency, you should make sure
                                that your rainy day funds go into an account that you’re not reaching into every day.
                                That way, you’ll know how much, exactly, you’ve already set aside, and you’ll protect
                                yourself from the temptation of using your savings for frivolous expenses. A
                                high-interest savings account is probably your best option: your stash can mature as
                                long as you’re not touching it, but it will still be easily accessible when it becomes
                                necessary.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">There are many creative ways to set money aside for your emergency
                                fund. First, by devoting a certain portion of your monthly budget to your savings, you
                                can set your sights on a specific date by which you’ll have enough money to rest easy.
                                Other ideas, like keeping a jar in your house for small bills that will eventually be
                                put into your emergency fund, can go a long way towards building savings quickly.</p>

                    <p class="card-text"> “In 7 weeks, under myBenki's expert guidance, I’ve completely changed my
                        relationship with money. I feel empowered. I’m clear on my goals. I have a great plan in place.
                        And I’ve never felt more in control of my finances.
                        I’d known for decades that there was something flawed in my thinking about money. I’d seen
                        psychologists to try to figure it out. But I never got even close to understanding the root of
                        what was going on. After one session with myBenki I had a complete breakthrough about my values
                        (which are great!) and how they were driving my spending (which was bad!). Within 3 sessions I
                        became aware of some deep-rooted, misguided beliefs.</p>

                        to understand my spending habits.
                        But above all I now have a structure not only in my financial thinking but also in my financial
                        management and can now see a direction with achievable goals and a path ahead.</p>

                        Let’s just say it was a challenge getting aligned to achieve my long term financial goals before
                        I started working with myBenki. Budgets don’t work for everyone, us included. So,myBenki
                        provided us with workable options that didn’t include a strict budget.
                        Throughout the programme, I got a true understanding of why I spend. I can recognise the
                        underlying need and have a way to address it when it arises.
